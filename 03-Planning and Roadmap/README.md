# Planning & Roadmap

This phase focused on defining a realistic, outcome-driven delivery plan for the pilot MVP â€” balancing user needs, business expectations, and technical capacity.

---

## Planning Objectives

- Convert discovery insights into a prioritized feature list
- Define MVP scope aligned with business goals and user value
- Establish a realistic delivery roadmap using Agile sprints
- Ensure buy-in from tech, operations, and business stakeholders

## PM Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Jira         | Sprint backlog and tracking |
| Confluence   | Planning docs, team wiki |
| Miro         | Feature prioritization and MVP scoping |
| Excel        | Initial release roadmap and resource mapping |
| Slack/MS Teams | Cross-functional communication |

---

## MVP Scope (Agreed Features)

| Feature | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Task list with close/update options | Core job task |
| Push notifications | Needed for urgent service alerts |
| Inventory barcode scanner | Reduce manual stock tracking |
| Offline sync | Ensure usability in low-signal areas |
| Tap-based checklist | Replace long manual entry forms |

We deliberately deferred advanced features (e.g., image capture, GPS tagging) to future phases.

## Pilot Roadmap Snapshot

| Sprint | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Sprint 0 | Setup, backlog creation, sprint planning |
| Sprint 1 | Core task module (add/update/close orders) |
| Sprint 2 | Notifications + barcode scanning |
| Sprint 3 | Offline mode and sync logic |
| Sprint 4 | Field testing with selected engineers |
| Sprint 5 | Feedback-driven adjustments + pilot wrap-up report |

## Capacity & Constraints Considered

- Part-time availability of back-end team
- Limited test devices in the field
- Security review cycle before pilot deployment
- Ops calendar (avoid overlapping peak maintenance weeks)

---

## PM Contribution in This Phase

- Facilitated MVP planning workshop with Ops, Product, and IT
- Used field research insights to guide **user-first prioritization**
- Mapped technical dependencies and aligned sprint timelines
- Flagged resource risks early and adjusted scope without sacrificing value
- Created a shared **pilot success checklist** to track readiness across teams

---

## Outcome of This Phase

- MVP backlog aligned and approved across functions
- Realistic 6-sprint roadmap created and tracked in Jira
- Shared expectations around scope, timeline, and trade-offs
