# Risks and Mitigation

This phase focused on identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks throughout the planning and pilot implementation of the mobile servicing app. A proactive approach was taken to reduce the likelihood of delays, resistance, or operational issues.

---

## Risk Management Approach

- Conducted risk identification workshops with stakeholders from IT, Operations, and Field Engineering
- Used a risk register to log, track, and monitor all risks
- Classified risks based on likelihood and impact (high/medium/low)
- Assigned risk owners and reviewed mitigation status in weekly syncs

## Key Risks and Mitigation Actions

| Risk Description                                       | Impact        | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low adoption by field engineers                        | High          | Medium     | Conducted early user interviews, co-created features with pilot users |
| Data syncing issues in low-connectivity areas          | High          | High       | Enabled offline mode with local caching and delayed sync logic        |
| Delays in integration with asset management system     | Medium        | High       | Set up integration parallel to development; coordinated with IT team  |
| Resistance from site managers to change current process| Medium        | Medium     | Communicated operational benefits; involved them in testing           |
| Cybersecurity concerns around real-time data capture   | High          | Low        | Consulted infosec team early; performed app penetration testing       |

## Ongoing Monitoring

- Weekly risk review during pilot phase status meetings
- Risk register updated in real-time with mitigation outcomes
- Escalation matrix was used in case of blockers affecting timeline or adoption

---

## PMâ€™s Role and Contribution

- Initiated the early risk discovery workshops across business and technical teams
- Maintained ownership of the risk register and ensured clear mitigation accountability
- Translated risk scenarios into stakeholder concerns and aligned communication accordingly
- Used Agile sprint planning and retrospectives to adjust based on real-time risk triggers

By anticipating potential obstacles and addressing them through structured mitigation, the project was able to stay on course and achieve successful pilot outcomes.
