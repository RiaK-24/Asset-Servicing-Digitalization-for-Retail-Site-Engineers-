## Business Impact

| Impact Area                            | Outcome Achieved                                                       |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service Order Cycle Time               | Reduced by 22% compared to the previous manual process                 |
| Engineer Productivity                  | Increased through real-time access to servicing data and alerts       |
| Manual Effort                          | Reduced need for physical logs and data re-entry                      |
| Data Accuracy                          | Improved due to in-app validations and real-time syncing              |
| User Satisfaction                      | Positive feedback from engineers during pilot review and survey       |
| Visibility for Operations Managers     | Better tracking of asset service requests and engineer activity       |
| Readiness for Scaling                  | Clear roadmap established for multi-site expansion                    |

## Strategic Takeaways

- Starting small with a pilot helped surface practical usability and infrastructure issues
- Real-time feedback loops ensured the product evolved based on user needs, not assumptions
- Offline-first design turned out to be a critical success factor for adoption
- Early alignment with security, IT, and change teams reduced blockers during rollout
- User co-creation through Lean UX increased ownership and reduced resistance

## Recommendations for Scaling

- Build a central knowledge base for new users and support teams
- Extend app integrations to include inventory and issue escalation systems
- Create a dashboard for operational KPIs aligned with service performance
- Onboard site managers as active contributors, not just communication nodes
- Continue Agile delivery model with quarterly feedback checkpoints post-launch

## PM’s Reflection and Value Delivered

- Facilitated a cross-functional effort that linked user experience, technology, and business needs
- Used structured delivery without losing flexibility, balancing Lean UX and Agile principles
- Delivered a pilot that not only met technical expectations but proved its business value
- Documented all processes, risks, and learnings to support future implementations
