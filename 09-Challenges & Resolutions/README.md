## Key Challenges and How They Were Addressed

| Challenge Description                                                                 | Resolution Strategy                                                                                   | Project Management Techniques Applied                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inconsistent workflows across different gas retail sites                               | Conducted field observations at 3 representative locations; built flexible feature flows              | Lean UX discovery, persona-driven scoping                  |
| Resistance from field engineers to shift from manual logs to digital tracking          | Identified change champions, conducted live demos, and provided app walkthroughs                      | Stakeholder engagement, change enablement planning         |
| Limited network connectivity at remote locations                                       | Designed app functionality to support offline updates with automatic syncing when reconnected         | Risk management planning, technical design mitigation      |
| Integration delays with central asset database                                         | Parallelized development and integration timelines; used mock APIs during initial development          | Agile sprint planning, dependency mapping                  |
| Balancing field feedback with scope and sprint timelines                               | Prioritized feedback into sprint backlogs using a structured decision matrix with product owner        | Sprint planning, backlog grooming, timeboxing              |

## Lessons Learned

- Early involvement of end users led to more relevant and accepted solutions
- Offline capability was not initially prioritized but became critical during testing
- Flexibility in planning helped absorb integration delays without blocking progress
- Combining Lean UX with Agile ensured quick iteration without compromising usability
- A structured pilot allowed us to test hypotheses before committing to full deployment

## PMâ€™s Role and Value Added

- Actively surfaced operational blockers during research and risk planning
- Facilitated decision-making during conflicts between usability and technical constraints
- Maintained clear documentation of challenge-resolution mapping for pilot review
- Ensured change champions were empowered to support adoption at field level
