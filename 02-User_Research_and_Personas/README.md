# User Research & Personas

This phase focused on understanding the actual workflows, pain points, and needs of field engineers to inform the design of a usable and valuable mobile solution.

---

## Objective of This Phase

- Understand current asset servicing workflows at retail gas stations
- Identify friction points in manual processes
- Define core user personas to guide solution design
- Validate that the mobile app features align with real needs

---

## Research Activities Conducted

- Shadowed 5 field engineers over 3 working days during service calls
- Conducted 1-on-1 interviews with:
  - Field engineers (5)
  - Ops supervisors (2)
  - Inventory coordinators (1)
- Reviewed legacy service order forms and internal process docs
- Observed environment limitations (device usage, signal strength, data entry conditions)

## Primary Persona: Field Engineer (Mobile-First User)

| Attribute            | Detail |
|----------------------|--------|
| Role                 | On-site equipment servicing and maintenance |
| Device               | Android tablet or rugged mobile phone |
| Current Pain Points  | Manual form-filling, re-entering data at office, delayed issue visibility |
| Goals                | Quick task updates, fewer repeated entries, real-time alerts for pending issues |
| Environment          | Outdoor, low-connectivity zones, glove use common |
| Tech Familiarity     | Comfortable with apps like WhatsApp and Maps; not deeply tech-savvy |

## Key Pain Points Uncovered

| Problem | Root Cause | Opportunity |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Manual logging of service orders | Paper-based forms still in use | Replace with in-app digital form |
| No real-time task updates | No mobile system access in field | Enable sync + offline data capture |
| Missing inventory tracking | Engineers carry stock but donâ€™t log usage | Add in-app inventory scan + update |
| Alerts missed or delayed | No notification system | Push alerts for overdue tasks or urgent tickets |

---

## MVP Feature Set (Informed by Research)

- Task list with ability to close/update service orders
- Barcode scan for inventory update
- Push notification alerts for time-sensitive issues
- Offline mode with sync on reconnect
- Quick tap checklist instead of typing forms

---

## PM Contribution in This Phase

- Designed interview scripts to focus on tasks, pain points, and tech gaps
- Facilitated research approval with operations leads
- Synthesized feedback into user journey maps and simplified pain-point matrix
- Drove **persona-first feature prioritization** in MVP planning sessions
- Used findings to challenge assumptions in initial app scope

---

## Outcome of This Phase

- Clear understanding of engineer workflows and constraints
- Defined Field Engineer persona used throughout project
- Prioritized features that matter most to users
- Set foundation for high adoption by designing for real user needs
