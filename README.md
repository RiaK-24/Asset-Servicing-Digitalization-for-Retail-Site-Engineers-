# Asset Servicing Digitalization for Retail Site Engineers

This case study showcases a pilot project to digitize the asset servicing process for field engineers at oil and gas retail sites. The goal was to replace manual, paper-based workflows with a mobile solution that enables real-time updates, inventory tracking, and service notifications — increasing operational efficiency, service visibility, and data accuracy across the field.

## Project Overview

- **Project Type:** Digital transformation pilot
- **Duration:** ~3 months (pilot phase)
- **Methodology:** Lean UX + Agile delivery
- **Outcome:** Real-time service updates, reduced manual entry, improved engineer experience
- **Tech Highlights:** Mobile app, real-time sync, offline capabilities, API integration

---

## Managed As a Lean, Agile Pilot

This was not a full-scale program but a carefully scoped pilot designed to:
- Validate **field usability** and adoption
- Identify technical constraints and integration risks early
- Deliver **quick wins** for stakeholders to build trust in the solution

The team used a **Lean UX** approach for discovery, followed by **Agile sprints** to build and iterate on MVP features based on feedback from real users in the field.

## Project Manager Value Add

As the PM, I contributed beyond traditional delivery responsibilities:

- **Initiated field research** to uncover service engineers' true pain points
- Defined **persona-based workflows** to guide app features and MVP scope
- Created and monitored **KPI dashboards** tied to service cycle time and user adoption
- Facilitated alignment between **IT, Operations, and Field Engineering**
- Advocated for a **pilot-first approach** to reduce risk and improve iteration cycles
- Delivered measurable improvements in **field turnaround times and data accuracy**
