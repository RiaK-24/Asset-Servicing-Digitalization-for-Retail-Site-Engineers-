# Change Management and Adoption

This phase focused on driving user adoption and minimizing resistance to change through structured communication, training, and support strategies. The change management approach was tightly integrated with pilot execution to ensure engagement and feedback loops.

## Objectives

- Ensure smooth transition from manual to digital servicing workflows
- Reduce adoption resistance among field service engineers
- Provide timely training, support, and reinforcement
- Build internal advocacy for full-scale rollout

---

## Activities Performed

- Created a stakeholder-specific change management plan aligned with the pilot
- Conducted readiness assessments with site managers and engineers
- Facilitated hands-on workshops and live demos for pilot users
- Designed and shared user guides, FAQs, and video walkthroughs
- Established a support channel (Slack/email) for real-time issue resolution
- Collected feedback post each interaction to tailor messaging and materials

## Adoption Strategy

- Identified early adopters and involved them in the co-design of pilot features
- Communicated the “why” behind the digital shift with clarity and consistency
- Addressed usability concerns during user testing and rolled updates accordingly
- Incorporated change champions at each retail site to support peer learning
- Used a phased onboarding plan to allow for gradual adoption

## Measurement of Adoption

| Metric                                 | Target           | Actual (Pilot Phase)   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| App onboarding completion rate         | 100% of pilot users | Achieved                |
| Feature usage (core workflows)         | >80% engagement     | Tracked via telemetry   |
| User feedback score (avg. rating)      | ≥ 8/10             | Achieved (8.3/10)       |
| Number of support requests post-pilot  | < 5/week           | 3/week average          |

## PM’s Role and Contribution

- Led the change enablement efforts end-to-end, from planning to rollout
- Acted as a single point of coordination across operations, IT, and field users
- Ensured training and support were delivered just-in-time and tailored to user needs
- Used pilot feedback to evolve both product features and communication strategy
