# Delivery Approach

The project adopted a hybrid methodology combining **Lean UX** for rapid user validation and **Agile delivery** for iterative development and deployment. This approach enabled fast learning, continuous feedback, and responsive adaptation to field needs during the pilot.

---

## Methodology Chosen: Lean UX + Agile Delivery

### Lean UX
- Used in the early phases to test user needs and workflows before development
- Emphasized quick iterations of wireframes and prototypes based on real feedback
- Allowed us to reduce waste by validating features before investing in code

### Agile (Scrum)
- Used for sprint-based delivery of functional mobile app features
- Two-week sprints enabled focused development and regular feedback
- Prioritized backlog items based on field engineer needs and business impact

---

## Why This Approach Was Chosen

- Needed fast validation of field workflows that varied across sites
- Product vision was clear, but user interactions needed exploration
- Real-time feedback from pilot users was critical to success
- Integration and compliance processes required some structure and planning

## Delivery Workflow

| Stage                          | Delivery Style     | Key Activities                                         |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Discovery & Research           | Lean UX            | Field interviews, journey mapping, persona creation    |
| Ideation & Prototyping         | Lean UX            | Sketching, rapid prototyping, feedback incorporation   |
| Feature Development            | Agile              | Sprint planning, development, demo reviews             |
| Feedback Loops (Pilot)         | Agile              | Field engineer feedback every 2 weeks, backlog updates |
| Integration & Security Review  | Structured/Hybrid  | Compliance, performance testing, documentation         |
| Change Management & Training   | Waterfall          | Scheduled onboarding, support material rollout         |

## Agile Delivery Practices Used

- Sprint backlog created and prioritized using user feedback
- JIRA used for sprint planning, issue tracking, and burndown metrics
- Sprint demos held bi-weekly with business and operations teams
- Retrospectives conducted to improve team velocity and processes
- Product Owner embedded in the team to provide rapid clarifications

## PMâ€™s Role and Contribution

- Facilitated Lean UX workshops and prototyping cycles with field users
- Aligned Agile team cadence with pilot and release timelines
- Balanced flexibility in design with discipline in compliance and rollout
- Helped teams focus on solving real user problems, not just delivering features
- Enabled tight feedback loops to ensure the product evolved with real-world needs

This approach allowed us to validate assumptions early, deliver incrementally, and continuously improve based on direct feedback from end users in the field.
