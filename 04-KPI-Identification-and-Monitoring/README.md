# KPI Identification and Monitoring

In this phase, I identified and validated the key performance indicators (KPIs) that would measure the success of the mobile app pilot and overall servicing process improvements.

---

## Objectives

- Align KPIs with both strategic business outcomes and operational improvements
- Select measurable, meaningful metrics that reflect the goals of field digitization
- Set baselines using existing data and define targets for post-rollout assessment
- Enable real-time tracking where possible through app integration

---

## KPI Identification Process

- **Workshops with Operations and Maintenance Leads** to understand expectations from digitalization
- **Field interviews with Engineers** to learn what success looks like on the ground
- **Historical data analysis** to establish current performance baselines
- **Cross-team alignment meetings** to validate chosen KPIs with Product, IT, and Compliance

## Final KPIs Selected

| KPI Description                                | Metric Type    | Baseline | Target (Pilot Phase) |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------|
| Average service order resolution time          | Efficiency     | 72 hrs   | 56 hrs (↓22%)         |
| Number of repeat visits for same asset issue   | Quality        | 18/mo    | <10/mo                |
| App adoption rate by engineers (pilot)         | Adoption       | N/A      | >75%                  |
| Real-time update accuracy                      | Data Quality   | N/A      | >95% accuracy         |
| Engineer-reported satisfaction (feedback form) | User Feedback  | N/A      | ≥8/10                 |

## Monitoring & Reporting Methods

- In-app telemetry and backend logs integrated with dashboard
- Manual feedback forms collected bi-weekly during pilot
- Weekly reporting cadence with pilot sponsor and operations
- Mid-pilot checkpoint review to tweak targets and track blockers

## PM’s Role and Value Add

- I led the design and alignment of measurable KPIs that tied project work to tangible business outcomes.
- Ensured KPIs were accessible and updated in near real-time to maintain visibility.
- Enabled leadership to make go/no-go decisions for full rollout based on objective pilot performance.
